**"Slack — especially on the #general channel, but really everywhere — does not allow for nuance, and is not built to foment discourse about sensitive topics..."**

**"I know this can be seen as an overreaction. I would absolutely love to facilitate a discussion about how best to handle/discuss stuff like this to make sure everyone feels included. I'll give some thought as to how to accomplish that soon (if you have suggestions please let me know)."**
